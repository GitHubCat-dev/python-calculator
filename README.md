# About this project

Originally I wanted to develop a full blown calculator with a GUI, but then for how much I knew back then I'd be wasting time. I probably wouldn't do this again though. I've lost interest.

This project is no longer maintained, and the repo is indefinitely archived. Use with caution.

Contact me through my work email for any inquiries.
