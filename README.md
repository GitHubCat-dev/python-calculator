# python-calculator

1.This is a command-line executable, written in Python 3.10.

2.The calculator supports 6 operations: +(addition), -(subtraction), *(multiplication), /(division), **(power), %(modulo). An additional module 

3.The source code is available in a Python source file.

Python IDLE is the ideal editor, but you can also use Visual Studio Code(with Python extension), Notepad++, Vim, etc.

4.If needed, use PyInstaller to publish your copy of the software as an executable.

5.Always check the downloaded files' integrity before opening. File hashes are provided with each new release.

6.You might wonder why there hasn't been a new release for a long time. Well it's because this calculator is just a project born out of impulse and thus won't be in active development. I'll release a new version when it's ready.
