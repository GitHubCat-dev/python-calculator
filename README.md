# python-calculator

1. This is a command-line executable, written in Python 3.10.

2. The calculator supports 6 operations: +(addition), -(subtraction), *(multiplication), /(division), **(power), %(modulo).

3. The source code is available in a Python source file.

Python IDLE is the ideal editor, but you can also use Visual Studio Code(with Python extension), Notepad++, Vim, etc.

4. If needed, use PyInstaller to publish your copy of the software as an executable.

5. Always check the downloaded files' integrity before opening. File hashes are provided with each new release.

WARNING: DO NOT DOWNLOAD OLD VERSIONS UNLESS ASKED. File hashes are only available for the current release in this Readme markdown file.

6. You might wonder why there hasn't been a new release for a long time. Well it's because this calculator is just a project born out of impulse and thus won't be in active development. I'll release a new version when it's ready.

7. File hashes for executables and source files. All hashes are SHA256 values.
